# TheMovieApp

TheMovieApp is the reimplementation of a previous project of mine. Now includes MVVM, generic API calls, coordinator pattern and no storyboards.

The app lets the user browse movies and TV shows, search by name, can view details, add to favorites and receive notification when a new episode is aired.
